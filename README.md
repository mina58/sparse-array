In some applications, we might want to represent an array with indices very
huge (e.g. 10^8), however, most of it are just zeros (e.g. 95%)

Creating such huge arrays is very time & memory harmful with no return
  Complete: 0 0 20 0 40 50 0 70 0 0
  Better: (50, 5), (20, 2), (70, 7), (40, 4) = (value, idx) list

A better idea is to represent such arrays using a linked list

Create a linked list: ArrayLinkedList
  Use a doubly linked list

It represents a sparse array. Provide the following functions
  Set and Get positions, Print array, add arrays

A useful application: Polynomial representation (e.g. 2X60 + 17X1500)
